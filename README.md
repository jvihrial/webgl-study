  This is my work area studying WebGL related stuff.

    Some of the stuff are based heavily on:
      http://learningwebgl.com/lessons/
    Which is a good tutorial on WebGL, recommend it to read.

    Unlike the ones on learningwebgl.com , these codes don't need anything
    from external sources, just clone the repo and run the index.html of the area.
